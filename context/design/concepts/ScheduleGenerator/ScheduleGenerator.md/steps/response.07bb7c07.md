# response:

Here's the refactored `ScheduleGenerator` concept specification:

***

## Refactored Concept: ScheduleGenerator

* **concept** ScheduleGenerator\[User]

* **purpose** to provide users with an optimized and regenerated schedule for their events and tasks based on their preferences

* **principle** If a user defines a set of fixed events and flexible tasks with deadlines and priorities, the concept will generate a schedule that accommodates all events and intelligently allocates time for tasks. If the user then adds, edits, or deletes an event or task, the schedule is automatically updated to reflect these changes optimally.

* **state**
  * an element ScheduleGeneratorSettings with
    * a lastScheduleId Number // A global counter to assign unique IDs to new schedule configurations. Implicitly initialized.
  * a set of Schedules with
    * an id Number // Unique identifier for the schedule configuration (assigned from `lastScheduleId`)
    * an owner User // The user who owns this schedule configuration
  * a set of Events with
    * an id Number // Unique identifier for the event
    * a name String
    * a schedule Schedule // A foreign key referencing the Schedule configuration this event belongs to
    * a startTime Time
    * an endTime Time
    * a repeatType RepeatType
  * a set of Tasks with
    * an id Number // Unique identifier for the task
    * a name String
    * a schedule Schedule // A foreign key referencing the Schedule configuration this task belongs to
    * a deadline Date
    * an expectedCompletionTime Number // Expected time in minutes
    * a completionLevel Percent // Percentage of task completed (0-100)
    * a priority Percent // Priority level (0-100, 100 being highest)
  * an enumeration RepeatType of ONCE or DAILY or WEEKLY or MONTHLY or YEARLY
  * // `Time`, `Date`, `Number`, `String`, `Percent` are assumed to be primitive types.

* **actions**
  * `initializeSchedule(owner: User): (scheduleId: Number)`
    * **requires**: `owner` exists.
    * **effects**:
      * Increments `ScheduleGeneratorSettings.lastScheduleId` by 1.
      * Creates a new empty `Schedule` entity with its `id` set to the new `ScheduleGeneratorSettings.lastScheduleId`, and its `owner` set to the provided `owner`.
      * Returns the `id` of the newly created `Schedule`.
  * `addEvent(scheduleId: Number, name: String, startTime: Time, endTime: Time, repeatType: RepeatType): (eventId: Number)`
    * **requires**: A `Schedule` with `id` `scheduleId` exists.
    * **effects**:
      * Creates a new `Event` entity with a unique `id`, the given `name`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `repeatType`.
      * Sets the `schedule` field of the new `Event` to reference the `Schedule` with `scheduleId`.
      * Returns the `id` of the newly created `Event`.
  * `editEvent(scheduleId: Number, eventId: Number, name: String, startTime: Time, endTime: Time, repeatType: RepeatType)`
    * **requires**:
      * A `Schedule` with `id` `scheduleId` exists.
      * An `Event` with `id` `eventId` exists and is associated with the `Schedule` `scheduleId`.
    * **effects**: Modifies the `Event` entity with `eventId` (which belongs to `scheduleId`) with the given `name`, `startTime`, `endTime`, and `repeatType`.
  * `deleteEvent(scheduleId: Number, eventId: Number)`
    * **requires**:
      * A `Schedule` with `id` `scheduleId` exists.
      * An `Event` with `id` `eventId` exists and is associated with the `Schedule` `scheduleId`.
    * **effects**: Deletes the `Event` entity with `eventId` from the set of `Events` associated with `scheduleId`.
  * `addTask(scheduleId: Number, name: String, deadline: Date, expectedCompletionTime: Number, priority: Percent): (taskId: Number)`
    * **requires**: A `Schedule` with `id` `scheduleId` exists.
    * **effects**:
      * Creates a new `Task` entity with a unique `id`, the given `name`, `deadline`, `expectedCompletionTime`, `priority`.
      * Initializes its `completionLevel` to 0%.
      * Sets the `schedule` field of the new `Task` to reference the `Schedule` with `scheduleId`.
      * Returns the `id` of the newly created `Task`.
  * `editTask(scheduleId: Number, taskId: Number, name: String, deadline: Date, expectedCompletionTime: Number, completionLevel: Percent, priority: Percent)`
    * **requires**:
      * A `Schedule` with `id` `scheduleId` exists.
      * A `Task` with `id` `taskId` exists and is associated with the `Schedule` `scheduleId`.
    * **effects**: Modifies the `Task` entity with `taskId` (which belongs to `scheduleId`) with the given `name`, `deadline`, `expectedCompletionTime`, `completionLevel`, and `priority`.
  * `deleteTask(scheduleId: Number, taskId: Number)`
    * **requires**:
      * A `Schedule` with `id` `scheduleId` exists.
      * A `Task` with `id` `taskId` exists and is associated with the `Schedule` `scheduleId`.
    * **effects**: Deletes the `Task` entity with `taskId` from the set of `Tasks` associated with `scheduleId`.
  * `generateSchedule(scheduleId: Number): (generatedSchedule: GeneratedSchedule | error: String)`
    * **requires**: A `Schedule` with `id` `scheduleId` exists.
    * **effects**:
      * Generates an optimal schedule (`generatedSchedule`) based on all `Events` and `Tasks` associated with `scheduleId`.
      * Events are scheduled at their specified `startTime`, `endTime`, and `repeatType`.
      * Tasks are scheduled in available time slots, prioritizing them according to the following heuristics: sooner `deadline`, higher `priority`, higher *remaining* `expectedCompletionTime` (i.e., `expectedCompletionTime` minus time already accounted for by `completionLevel`), and tasks that have already been started (`completionLevel` > 0%).
      * If a valid schedule cannot be generated, returns an `error` string.
      * Returns the `generatedSchedule`, which is an abstract complex data structure representing the concrete time blocks and associated events/tasks for a specified period (e.g., a list of `ScheduledItem` objects with `start`, `end`, and a pointer to the `Event` or `Task` ID). (Note: `GeneratedSchedule` is an output format, not part of this concept's persistent state.)
