# response:

The previous error message regarding `completionLevel` in the `editTask` action was due to a missing comma in the concept specification for `editTask`. The TypeScript implementation of `editTask` was already correct and included `completionLevel` (and `oldTask`) as intended.

Regarding your request to ensure `addTask` initializes `completionLevel` to 0:
Upon reviewing the provided concept specification, the `addTask` action's `effects` clause already explicitly states: "...and 0% for `completionLevel`...". Similarly, the TypeScript implementation of `addTask` correctly sets `completionLevel: 0` for new tasks. The test file also includes an assertion to verify this behavior. Therefore, no modifications are needed for the `addTask` action concerning `completionLevel` initialization, as it is already correctly defined and implemented.

The main change required is to correct the typographical error in the concept specification for `editTask`. With this correction, all stated requirements and expected behaviors are aligned.

Here are the updated files:
