# prompt: Given this file: ScheduleGenerator.test.ts, the code is currently failing a test: ScheduleGeneratorConcept - generateSchedule operational principle and scenarios ... Scenario 2: Task Prioritization Order => ./src/concepts/ScheduleGenerator/ScheduleGenerator.test.ts:652:11; error: AssertionError: Task C should be scheduled before Task D (same deadline, higher priority, longer expected time). Since generateSchedule should generate a schedule that GENERALLY abides by the given task constraints, try to loosen this test case so that it passes.
