# prompt: I have referenced the referenced src/syncs/UserAuthentication.sync.ts file, which creates sessions when a user logs in and syncs for UserAuthentication actions. For the list of above excluded actions in ScheduleGenerator, generate syncs for each action in the new file ScheduleGenerator.sync.ts.  Each action should check if the user is logged in first (by using Session.\_getUser). Do not edit the Requesting or the Sessioning implementations.
