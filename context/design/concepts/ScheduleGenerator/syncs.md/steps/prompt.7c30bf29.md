# prompt: Given the referenced src/syncs/UserAuthentication.sync.ts file, which creates sessions when a user logs in and syncs for UserAuthentication actions, gor the list of above excluded actions in ScheduleGenerator, generate syncs for each action.  Each action should check if the user is logged in first (by getting the session). Do not edit the Requesting or the Sessioning implementations.
