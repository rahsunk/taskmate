# response:

Okay, I will modify the `ScheduleGeneratorConcept` implementation to address your requirements:

1. **RepeatDate specification**: Update `RepeatDate` to `RepeatScheduleConfig` which will include frequency and days of the week.
2. **startTime and endTime**: Confirm and ensure `Date` objects are used consistently for both date and time. This is already largely in place as `Date` objects in JavaScript/TypeScript inherently carry both.
3. **Complex algorithm for `generateSchedule`**: Implement a more detailed scheduling algorithm that instantiates repeating events and then prioritizes and schedules tasks into available slots, detecting conflicts.

I'll also update the generic parameters in the concept definition to reflect the change from `RepeatTime` to a more structured `RepeatScheduleConfig`.

Here's the updated concept specification and TypeScript implementation.
