# response:

You are absolutely right! My apologies for overlooking that specific detail in the event scheduling loop. The error message and your clarification were pointing directly to it.

The issue was indeed in the `generatedPlan.push` call within the *event* instantiation loop. While local variables `scheduledEventStartTime` and `scheduledEventEndTime` were correctly declared, the object literal was attempting to use shorthand property names `scheduledStartTime` and `scheduledEndTime` which did not exist as local variables in that scope, leading to the "Cannot find name" error.

I have corrected this by explicitly assigning the `scheduledEventStartTime` and `scheduledEventEndTime` variables to the `scheduledStartTime` and `scheduledEndTime` properties of the `ScheduledItem` object, similar to how it was handled for tasks.

Here is the updated `ScheduleGeneratorConcept.ts` file with this fix:
