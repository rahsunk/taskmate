# response:

You are absolutely right. The TypeScript errors are due to two main reasons:

1. **Missing `assert` import**: The `assert` function from `jsr:@std/assert` was not explicitly imported, leading to "Cannot find name 'assert'".
2. **Incorrect type narrowing in error messages**: While the `isQueryErrorResponse` type guard correctly narrows the type of the *entire array* (e.g., `scheduleByOwnerResult` becomes `Array<{error: string}>`), inside the `assert(false, ...)` message string interpolation, TypeScript often doesn't perform this narrowing for *individual elements* within the array (e.g., `scheduleByOwnerResult[0]`). This means `scheduleByOwnerResult[0]` is still treated as `Array<T | {error: string}>[0]`, which is `T | {error: string}`, leading to the "Property 'error' does not exist" error when trying to access `.error` directly or with `?.` without explicit narrowing.

I will fix these issues by:

1. Adding `assert` to the import statement.
2. Adjusting the `assert(false, ...)` lines within the `isQueryErrorResponse` blocks to correctly narrow the type of the array element before accessing its `error` property.
