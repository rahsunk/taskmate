# response:

You are absolutely correct! My sincere apologies for that oversight. The `nonExistentId` variable was indeed scoped incorrectly. In Deno's `t.step` context, variables are not automatically shared between steps unless declared at the `Deno.test`'s top level.

I've fixed this by declaring `nonExistentId` locally within both `Scenario 4` and `Scenario 5`. Additionally, I've refined the assertion messages in `Scenario 2` for clarity and re-evaluated the cumulative counts for `_getAllSchedules`, `_getAllEvents`, and `_getAllTasks` in `Scenario 5` based on the sequential execution of `t.step` blocks to ensure those assertions are accurate.

Here is the corrected and updated `src/ScheduleGenerator/ScheduleGeneratorConcept.test.ts` file:
