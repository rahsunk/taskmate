# trace: ScheduleGenerator Operational Principle Test

The operational principle for `ScheduleGenerator` states: "Given a set of events and tasks, an optimal schedule for the user is created. When events and tasks are updated and removed, the schedule is regenerated."

This trace demonstrates the initial creation and generation part of the principle:

1. **Initialize Schedule**: A user (e.g., `user:Alice`) initializes their personal schedule. This creates a new `Schedule` document and assigns it a unique internal `scheduleID`.
   * **Action**: `initializeSchedule({ owner: "user:Alice" })`
   * **Expected Effect**: A new `Schedule` record is created, e.g., `{ _id: "schedule:abc", owner: "user:Alice", scheduleID: 1 }`. The action returns the `_id` of the new schedule.
   * **Verification**: A `_getScheduleByOwner` query confirms the schedule's existence and its `_id`.

2. **Add Daily Event**: The user adds a recurring daily event, such as a "Daily Standup" meeting from 9 AM to 10 AM.
   * **Action**: `addEvent({ schedule: "schedule:abc", name: "Daily Standup", startTime: <9AM_Today>, endTime: <10AM_Today>, repeat: { frequency: DAILY } })`
   * **Expected Effect**: A new `Event` record is created, linked to `scheduleID: 1`, with its own unique `_id` and an incremented `eventID`. The action returns the `_id` of the new event.
   * **Verification**: A `_getEventDetails` query confirms the event's attributes.

3. **Add High Priority Task**: The user adds a high-priority task with a relatively close deadline and a specific expected completion time (e.g., "Finish Project Report" due tomorrow, 2 hours remaining, 90% priority).
   * **Action**: `addTask({ schedule: "schedule:abc", name: "Finish Project Report", deadline: <Tomorrow_5PM>, expectedCompletionTime: 120, completionLevel: 0, priority: 90 })`
   * **Expected Effect**: A new `Task` record is created, linked to `scheduleID: 1`, with its own unique `_id` and an incremented `taskID`. The action returns the `_id` of the new task.
   * **Verification**: A `_getTaskDetails` query confirms the task's attributes.

4. **Add Low Priority Task**: The user adds another task with a longer deadline and lower priority (e.g., "Review Documentation" due in 3 days, 3 hours, 30% priority).
   * **Action**: `addTask({ schedule: "schedule:abc", name: "Review Documentation", deadline: <3DaysLater_5PM>, expectedCompletionTime: 180, completionLevel: 0, priority: 30 })`
   * **Expected Effect**: Another new `Task` record is created, linked to `scheduleID: 1`, with its own unique `_id` and an incremented `taskID`. The action returns the `_id` of the new task.
   * **Verification**: Another `_getTaskDetails` query confirms this task's attributes.

5. **Generate Schedule**: The user triggers the schedule generation process.
   * **Action**: `generateSchedule({ schedule: "schedule:abc" })`
   * **Expected Effect**: The system retrieves all events and tasks for `scheduleID: 1`, instantiates the daily event across the planning horizon, and then attempts to fit the tasks into the available free time slots, prioritizing the "Finish Project Report" (sooner deadline, higher priority) over "Review Documentation". The action returns a `generatedPlan` array containing `ScheduledItem` objects for both events and tasks. No error is returned as all items are expected to be schedulable.
   * **Verification**: The `generatedPlan` is inspected.
     * It contains multiple instances of "Daily Standup" events, appearing at the correct times on multiple days.
     * It contains the "Finish Project Report" and "Review Documentation" tasks.
     * The "Finish Project Report" is expected to be scheduled earlier or take precedence in slot allocation compared to "Review Documentation", reflecting the prioritization logic.
     * The total scheduled time for tasks should match their remaining `expectedCompletionTime`.

This trace confirms that the `ScheduleGenerator` concept can successfully initialize a schedule, store events and tasks with their properties, and then correctly apply its scheduling logic to produce a coherent plan, fulfilling its core purpose. Subsequent tests (not explicitly detailed in this single trace, but present in the full test file) would cover updating/removing events/tasks and regenerating the schedule, as well as handling edge cases and error conditions.
