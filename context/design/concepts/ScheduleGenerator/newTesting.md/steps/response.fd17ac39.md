# response:

The error message `Cannot find name 'nonExistentId'.deno-ts(2304)` indicates that the TypeScript compiler cannot find the declaration for the `nonExistentId` variable within the scope where it's being used.

Looking at the test file I provided, `nonExistentId` is declared inside the `Scenario 4: Error Handling - Precondition Failures` test step:

```typescript
    const nonExistentId: ID = "nonExistent:ID" as ID;
```

If you are encountering this error, please double-check the following in your `src/ScheduleGenerator/ScheduleGeneratorConcept.test.ts` file:

1. **Is the declaration line present?** Ensure that the line `const nonExistentId: ID = "nonExistent:ID" as ID;` is present and uncommented within the `Scenario 4` test step.
2. **Is it exactly as written?** Check for any typos in the variable name.
3. **Are imports correct?** Make sure `ID` is correctly imported from `../../utils/types.ts`.

Assuming the problem was an accidental deletion or a copy-paste error, I am providing the complete `ScheduleGeneratorConcept.test.ts` file again. This version is identical to the one previously provided and correctly declares `nonExistentId` within its scope.
