# response:

Here's the refactored `ItemSharing` concept, made even more generic. It now acts purely as a **change coordination mechanism** for an item whose mutable properties reside in another concept. All direct references to "time/date" are removed, and the concept no longer explicitly stores the `currentSharedPayload` itself. Instead, it manages the proposals for a `SharedPayload` change, and an external synchronization would apply confirmed changes to the actual item in its originating concept.
