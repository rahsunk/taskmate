# response:

Here's a refactored version of the `UserAuthentication` concept, addressing the points raised by the Concept Design Rubric and the provided background information.

The main issues in the original concept were:

1. **Separation of Concerns & Independence**: The purpose and principle conflated core authentication (verifying identity) with concerns like "finding users by name" for "sharing events," which belongs to a `UserProfile` or `Friend` concept.
2. **Completeness**: Missing essential actions for a full lifecycle, such as changing a password or deleting an account.
3. **Actions**: The `verify` action was essentially a getter/query, which should typically be implicit or explicitly defined as a query, not a state-mutating action.

***

### Refactored Concept: UserAuthentication

* **concept**: UserAuthentication \[User]
  * *Rationale*: The generic `User` type correctly indicates that the concept deals with user identities without knowing their specific properties from other concepts.
* **purpose**: Limit access to known users and securely manage their authentication credentials.
  * *Rationale*: This purpose is now solely focused on authentication. It removes the conflated "find users by name" part, aligning with `Independence` and `Separation of Concerns`. It also explicitly mentions "manage their authentication credentials" to encompass password changes, which improves `Completeness`.
* **principle**: After a user registers with a unique username and a password, they can repeatedly authenticate with those credentials to prove their identity. If they need to update their password, they can do so, maintaining continuous access.
  * *Rationale*: This principle focuses on the core lifecycle of authentication (register, authenticate, change password). It removes references to "looking up by other users" or "sharing events" to maintain `Independence` and `Separation of Concerns`. It also hints at the `changePassword` action, improving `Completeness`.
* **state**:
  ```
  a set of Users with
    a username String
    a password String
  ```
  * *Rationale*: This state is minimal and perfectly suited for the core purpose of authentication. It stores exactly what is needed for registration, authentication, password changes, and account deletion. It avoids storing extraneous information, adhering to `Separation of Concerns`.
* **actions**:
  * `register (username: String, password: String): (user: User)`
    * **requires**: no `User` with the given `username` already exists.
    * **effects**: A new `User` is created, associated with the provided `username` and `password`, and returned.
    * *Rationale*: Essential action for setting up the state.
  * `authenticate (username: String, password: String): (user: User)`
    * **requires**: A `User` exists with the matching `username` and `password`.
    * **effects**: The `User` associated with the validated credentials is returned, granting access to the authenticated identity.
    * *Rationale*: Core action for the concept's purpose.
  * `changePassword (user: User, oldPassword: String, newPassword: String)`
    * **requires**: The specified `user` exists and its current `password` matches `oldPassword`.
    * **effects**: The `password` for the `user` is updated to `newPassword`.
    * *Rationale*: This action is crucial for `Completeness`, allowing users to manage their credentials over the concept's lifecycle.
  * `deleteAccount (user: User)`
    * **requires**: The specified `user` exists.
    * **effects**: The `user` and its associated `username` and `password` are permanently removed from the system.
    * *Rationale*: This action provides the necessary "undo" or deletion functionality, improving `Completeness` and covering the full lifecycle of a user account within this concept.
