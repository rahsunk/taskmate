# prompt: There are currently many Typescript errors as a result of assuming the type of a variable that is a union type. For example: Argument of type '{ user: ID; } | { error: string; }' is not assignable to parameter of type '{ error?: string | undefined; }'.  Type '{ user: ID; }' has no properties in common with type '{ error?: string | undefined; }'.deno-ts(2345). Resolve these errors.
