# prompt: Given this example sync file, which creates sessions when a user logs in, for the list of above excluded actions in UserAuthentication, generate syncs for each action, where each action should check if a user logs in. Do not edit the Requesting nor the Sessioning implementations, but feel free to edit the UserAuthentication implementation so that the syncs work better. Consider when sessions should be created.
