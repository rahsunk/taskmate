# prompt: Given this example sync file, which creates sessions when a user logs in, for the list of above excluded actions in UserAuthentication, generate syncs for each action. register and authenticate should create a session for the user, and the other actions should check if a user logs in (by getting the session). Do not edit the Requesting nor the Sessioning implementations, but feel free to edit the UserAuthentication implementation so that the syncs work better.
