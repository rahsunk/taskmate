# response:

Here is the updated concept specification for `Notification`, incorporating the refinements discussed and aligning it more closely with the Simple State Form (SSF) principles and the provided TypeScript implementation.

I've clarified the types for clarity (e.g., `EmailAddress`, `DailyTime`), added `notificationType` to the state as it's crucial for matching, included `errorMessage` for `SentNotifications`, and adjusted action parameters/results to align with best practices (e.g., using `ID` for referencing objects instead of passing full objects, and returning `{ error: String }` for failures).
