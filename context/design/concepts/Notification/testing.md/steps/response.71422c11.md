# response:

You're absolutely right! The current test file relies on non-null assertions (`!`) which, while often acceptable in test code after an `assertExists` check, don't explicitly narrow the type of the *entire object* from a union type. This can lead to less robust type-checking and potentially mask issues if the structure of the returned error object changes.

To resolve this, I will refactor the test code to use explicit type guards (`if ('error' in result)`) to narrow down the union type, making the type assertions more robust and satisfying TypeScript's strictness.

Here's the updated `NotificationConcept.test.ts` file with these corrections:
