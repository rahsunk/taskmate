# response:

Here's a refactored `Notification` concept that maintains modularity and separation of concerns with `ScheduleGenerator`. The key is to make `Notification` generic about *what* it's notifying about (`TargetItem`) and to separate the *logic of when to notify* (which belongs to `ScheduleGenerator` or an orchestrating concept) from the *mechanism of sending and tracking notifications* (which belongs to `Notification`).
