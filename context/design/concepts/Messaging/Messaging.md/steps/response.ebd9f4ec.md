# response:

Here's a concept design for Messaging, following the provided rubric:

***

**concept** Messaging \[User]

**purpose** Enable users to exchange textual communications with one another in a persistent and asynchronous manner.

**principle** After a user initiates a conversation by sending a message to another user, that user can then view the message and send a reply, and both users can subsequently review the full history of their exchanges.

**state**

```
a set of Conversations with
  a participants set of User
  an optional name String
  
a set of Messages with
  a sender User
  a content String
  a sentAt DateTime
  a Conversation
```

**actions**

* **createConversation (participants: set of User, name: optional String): (conversation: Conversation)**
  * **requires**:
    * The `participants` set is not empty.
    * All `User` identifiers in `participants` are valid (exist in an external User concept).
    * If `name` is omitted and `participants` contains exactly two users, there is no existing `Conversation` between these specific two users without a name.
  * **effects**:
    * A new `Conversation` object `c` is created.
    * `c.participants` is set to the provided `participants`.
    * `c.name` is set to the provided `name` if present, otherwise it is null.
    * The newly created `Conversation` `c` is returned.

* **sendMessage (conversation: Conversation, sender: User, content: String): (message: Message)**
  * **requires**:
    * The `conversation` exists.
    * The `sender` is an element of `conversation.participants`.
    * The `content` string is not empty.
  * **effects**:
    * A new `Message` object `m` is created.
    * `m.sender` is set to the provided `sender`.
    * `m.content` is set to the provided `content`.
    * `m.sentAt` is set to the current `DateTime`.
    * `m.Conversation` is set to the provided `conversation`.
    * The newly created `Message` `m` is returned.

* **addParticipant (conversation: Conversation, newParticipant: User, actor: User)**
  * **requires**:
    * The `conversation` exists.
    * The `newParticipant` exists (in an external User concept).
    * The `newParticipant` is not already in `conversation.participants`.
    * The `actor` is an element of `conversation.participants` (for authorization).
  * **effects**:
    * `newParticipant` is added to the `conversation.participants` set.

* **removeParticipant (conversation: Conversation, participantToRemove: User, actor: User)**
  * **requires**:
    * The `conversation` exists.
    * The `participantToRemove` is an element of `conversation.participants`.
    * The `actor` is an element of `conversation.participants` (for authorization).
    * `participantToRemove` is not the only participant remaining in `conversation.participants`.
  * **effects**:
    * `participantToRemove` is removed from the `conversation.participants` set.

* **deleteMessage (message: Message, actor: User)**
  * **requires**:
    * The `message` exists.
    * The `actor` is the `message.sender` (or an authorized administrator, not specified here).
  * **effects**:
    * The `message` is deleted.

**Synchronizations for security:**

* **Authorization for actions**: The `actor: User` arguments in `addParticipant`, `removeParticipant`, and `deleteMessage` imply synchronizations with an external `Authentication` or `Session` concept to ensure the `actor` is the currently authenticated user, and with `Messaging`'s own state to check if the `actor` has permission (e.g., is a participant or sender).

**Synchronizations to maintain coherent state:**

* **Conversation deletion**: If a `Conversation`'s `participants` set becomes empty (e.g., via `removeParticipant` actions), a synchronization could be defined to delete the `Conversation` and all associated `Messages`.
  ```
  sync CascadeEmptyConversationDeletion
  when
      Messaging.removeParticipant (conversationId, participantId, actorId)
  where
      in Messaging: participants of conversationId is empty after action
  then
      Messaging.deleteConversation (conversationId) // An implicit action or a direct state mutation
      for each message in Messaging.getMessages(conversationId):
          Messaging.deleteMessage (message)
  ```
  *(Note: `deleteConversation` and `getMessages` are conceptual for the sync example, not explicit actions above to keep concept minimal)*
