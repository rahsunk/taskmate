# response:

Here's the simplified `Messaging` concept, tailored for one-to-one conversations between two users:

***

* **concept** Messaging \[User]
* **purpose** Enable two specific users to exchange textual communications with one another in a persistent and asynchronous manner.
* **principle** After two users establish a conversation, either user can send a message to the other, view previous messages, and reply, thus building a persistent history of their one-to-one exchange.
* **state**
  * a set of `Conversations` with
    * a `participant1` of type `User`
    * a `participant2` of type `User`
    * a `conversationId` of type `Number`
  * a set of `Messages` with
    * a `conversationId` of type `Number`
    * a `sender` of type `User`
    * a `content` of type `String`
    * a `sentAt` of type `Date`
* **actions**
  * `createConversation (user1: User, user2: User): (conversationId: Number)`
    * **requires** `user1` and `user2` exist, and `user1` is not the same as `user2`. No `Conversation` already exists where `(participant1 = user1 AND participant2 = user2) OR (participant1 = user2 AND participant2 = user1)`.
    * **effects** A new `Conversation` is created with `participant1` set to `user1`, `participant2` set to `user2`, and a fresh `conversationId` is generated and returned. (The order of `participant1` and `participant2` may be canonicalized, e.g., by ID).
  * `sendMessage (conversationId: Number, sender: User, content: String): (message: Message)`
    * **requires** A `Conversation` with the given `conversationId` exists. `sender` is either `participant1` or `participant2` of that `Conversation`. `content` is not empty.
    * **effects** A `message` is created and returned where `message.conversationId` is set to the provided `conversationId` and `message.sender` and `message.content` are set to their respective parameters, with `message.sentAt` is set to the current `Date`
