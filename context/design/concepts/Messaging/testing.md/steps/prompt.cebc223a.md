# prompt: Error: Property 'length' does not exist on type 'ConversationDoc\[] | { error: string; }'., Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type '0' can't be used to index type 'ConversationDoc\[] | { error: string; }'.  Property '0' does not exist on type 'ConversationDoc\[] | { error: string; }'. Also there are still errors for 'error' does not exist for (some union type)
