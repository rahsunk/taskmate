Here's a concept design for Messaging, following the provided rubric:

***

* \***concept** Messaging \[User]
* **purpose** Enable users to exchange textual communications with one another in a persistent and asynchronous manner.
* **principle** After a user initiates a conversation by sending a message to another user, that user can then view the message and send a reply, and both users can subsequently review the full history of their exchanges.
* **state**
  * a set of `Conversations` with
    * an `owner` of type `User`
    * a set of `participants` of type `User`
    * a `name` of type `String`
    * a `conversationId` of type `Number` (static attribute, initially -1)
  * a set of `Messages` with
    * a `sender` of type `User`
    * a `content` of type `String`
    * a `sentAt` of type `Date`
    * a `conversationId` of type `Number`
* **actions**
  * `createConversation (owner: User, name: String): (conversation: Conversation)`
    * **requires** `owner` and name exists
    * **effects** A new `conversation` is created and returned with `conversation.owner` and `conversation.name` set to their respective parameters and static attribute `conversationId` incrementing by 1.
  * `sendMessage (conversation: Conversation, sender: User, content: String): (message: Message)`
    * **requires** `conversation` exists, `sender` is an element of `conversation.participants`, and `content` is not empty.
    * **effects** A `message` is created and returned where `message.sender` and `message.content` are set to their respective parameters, `message.sentAt` is set to the current `Date`
  * `addParticipant (conversation: Conversation, newParticipant: User, owner: User)`
    * **requires** `conversation`, `owner`, and `newParticipant`exist and `newParticipant` is not already in `conversation.participants`.
    * **effects** `newParticipant` is added to the `conversation.participants` set.
  * `removeParticipant (conversation: Conversation, participantToRemove: User, owner: User)`
    * **requires** `conversation`, `owner`, and `newParticipant`exist and `newParticipant` is in `conversation.participants`.
    * **effects** `newParticipant` is removed from the `conversation.participants` set.
