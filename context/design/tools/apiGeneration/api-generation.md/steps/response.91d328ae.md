# response:

I have analyzed the provided concept specifications and implementations for `ScheduleGenerator`, `UserAuthentication`, `Notification`, and `ItemSharing`. I have updated the API documentation to reflect all requests (actions and queries) as `POST` requests, moving all parameters to the request body. Additionally, I've ensured that queries returning a single object are wrapped in an array for consistency, as per the specified API structure rules. I've also updated the concept specifications for `UserAuthentication`, `Notification`, and `ItemSharing` to explicitly include all documented queries.
