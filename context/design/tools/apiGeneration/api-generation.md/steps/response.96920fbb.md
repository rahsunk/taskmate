# response:

Here's an updated `UserAuthentication` concept specification and its corresponding TypeScript implementation, including the requested GET endpoints for querying users and sessions.

Given that the original document describes `UserAuthentication` state as:

```
a set of Users with
  a username String
  a password String
```

and `a set of Sessions with a user User a sessionID String`, I will base the implementation on this structure.

For security reasons, the `_getUserDetails` query will *not* expose the password, even if it's stored in the database. The `UserAuthentication` concept's purpose is to *authenticate*, not to expose credentials. The `login` action handles password verification.
