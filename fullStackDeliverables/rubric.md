## Rubric

|Component|Description (what good work looks like)|Common Failures (examples of falling short)|
|---|---|---|
|**Functionality**|The app fulfills its intended purpose, supporting all the necessary functionality.|Some needed functionality is missing or broken.|
|**Authentication**|Actions are authenticated and access is controlled appropriately using back-end synchronizations.|Authentication or access control guards are missing or are implemented only in the front end.|
|**Syncs**|Syncs are formulated and used well, and are factored out to ensure consistency and minimize duplication.|Some obvious syncs are missing (eg, with the front end being used for a sync that should be in the back end); syncs contain needless duplications or other complications.|
|**Deployment**|The app is deployed and running at a public URL.|The app only runs locally, or the app fails to run when its public URL is accessed.|
|**Video**|Video demonstrates a compelling user journey and illustrates the key features of the app.|Video is hard to follow, doesn’t convey an intelligible user journey, or fails to explain the key features of the app.|
|**Design**|The design document describes a thoughtful process, documents reasonable changes and corresponds to the final app.|The design document is uneven, fails to explain important decisions, or does not properly document the final state of the app.|
|**Reflection**|The reflection document includes insightful comments about your experience that demonstrate real learning.|The reflection document is rote and superficial, or makes generic observations that do not seem to reflect real learning.|
