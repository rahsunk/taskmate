# Reflections

## General experience
- I first found it difficult to understand concept design, as I was used to object-oriented programming which differs from the framework of concepts taught in this class.
- I do not think I fully understand how to write concepts until Assignment 4a, which was when we had to refine our concepts created in Assignment 2-3.
- Usually, using the LLM to do something new for a concept, whether it was creating a Typescript implementation, test file, or sync file was difficult for me. But after a few tries and troubleshooting, I would be able to do the same for other concepts much faster.
- I found implementing the backend and frontend using Claude Code as my agentic tool to be mostly easy, but having both work together was hard. I sometimes had to tell my agents in both repositories information about the other, which isn't the best coding practice.
- I couldn't get a Cursor Pro trial or GitHub student pack using my student account, but luckily I had a trial for Claude Code Pro for the whole semester. However, as my project got larger, I would quickly run out of context for the agent, and I would frequently be locked out from using it further until I waited a certain number of hours.

## Skills acquired
- I feel confident on designing concepts based on what I learned in class, and implementing a prototype of them.
- I also feel confident in using Context to help me produce better implementations of concepts and write test cases for them to determine things that can go wrong.
- I learned the Vue framework for implementing web applications, which helped to consolidate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all into reusable components.
- I learned how to implement calls to API endpoints in the frontend, in which the requests can return a response that can be rendered in the frontend.

## Things I can improve on
- I think I definitely need to improve my understanding of stores for Vue components, as I had trouble understanding the files for stores Claude created for me when I was implementing my frontend.
- I also want to improve my understanding of implementing concept syncs; I had to learn the rules as I was using Context and Claude to implement syncs for all of my concepts, and I needed help knowing where to place console.log lines to debug the syncs.

## LLM use
- I used Context in the design folder of the backend repository, helping me initialize implementations, test cases, API specifications, and sync files for each concept.
- I used Claude Code as my agentic coding tool in both the backend and frontend repositories, in which I would mostly ask it to fix errors I noticed after placing my implementation and sync files in the src folder.

## My thoughts on LLMs in Software Development
- I acknowledge the great power LLMs can have in creating implementations of apps in minutes. I think that this could reduce the need for old ways of prototyping apps through wireframes.
- However, LLMs can grow a project at such a fast rate that a software engineer would struggle to understand it.
- I think if you use the LLM as a "tool", and mae sure that you are smarter than this "tool", it can be a very effective technology in software development.
