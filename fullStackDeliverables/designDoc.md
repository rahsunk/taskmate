## Differences from Visual Design in Assignment 4b

- Made the Change Password blue if passwords match, gray otherwise like with the register button
- Made the time and day columns in schedule align properly (by setting the height of them to be equal)
- Added bottom margin to profile page to match the existing top margin
- For non-repeating events, the event cards only display the times on the Schedule page
- Repeating events that had start/end times on past days are no longer greyed out
