- Fixed `editTask` so that its postcondition refers to modifying `oldTask` in the set of `Tasks` in `schedule`.
- Added `initializeSchedule` so that a user can create a `Schedule`
- Modified `Event` and `Task` states to have a `name` of type `String`, which `addEvent`, `editEvent`, `addTask`, `editTask`
- `generateSchedule` is no longer a system action, can now be invoked manually.
